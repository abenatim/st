* st - simple terminal

=st= is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

* Personal fork

This version of st includes the following changes:
- Custom default colorscheme and font (custom Iosvkem and Iosevka)
- alpha patch
- scrollback patch
- clipboard patch

* Requirements

In order to build =st= you need the =Xlib= header files.

* Installation

Edit =config.mk= to match your local setup (this fork of =st= is
installed into the =/usr= namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install =st= (if
necessary as root):

#+begin_src sh
  make clean install
#+end_src
